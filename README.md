**K Anonymity**

I wrote this code to simulate the distorting effect of "K Anonymity" as a deidentification technique as part of a Course 3.1 on Data Privacy for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' LEARN course. The purpose of this simulation was to demonstrate the delicate balance which must be struck in making data available to the public while following HIPPA protections.

*01_simulation_files* - This creates four different scenarios with progressive deidenitification

*02_create_html* - This is code genereated by Gemeni which turns the Plotly objects into an HTML file and records of the 3D objects rotating

*k_anon_simulation_data.csv* - This is the output of all four scenarios as a dataframe
